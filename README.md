# Oil_n_Gas_Dashboard
A real-time monitoring dashboard built with Flask, Chart.js, and AI integration to simulate oil and gas pipeline sensor data. It visualizes live readings for temperature, pressure, and flow rate, automatically triggers high-pressure alerts, and uses OpenAIâ€™s API to generate intelligent performance analyses on demand.
